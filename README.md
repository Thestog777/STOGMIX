Smile and Wave!, Smile and Wave! 
Iâ€™m on an exciting journey to create my own music, and while itâ€™s been 
quite challenging, Iâ€™m loving every moment of it. ðŸŽ¶ Iâ€™ve got some awesome 
lyrics and a unique voice that Iâ€™ve been told stands out. Now, Iâ€™m on the 
lookout for a band to collaborate with and bring these songs to life.

When Iâ€™m not immersed in music, youâ€™ll find me diving into the world of 
computers/Linux. Iâ€™m a bit of a tech enthusiast, AI-Web 3, Crypto, 
Pod-Casting, Movies, Travel-Explore.

I also enjoy being out and about, like the wind, always on the move and 
seeking new adventures. And; You Know! Musical Mystery Tour, or 
If youâ€™re into music, tech, or a woman, Who,d like a little 
Chat & Chill or the Rabbit hole, Yes!, Me Too! My: New friend, 
letâ€™s connect!
